# qr-code-generator

This is a mini project involving custom code that generates a QR code using an HTML/JavaScript canvas.

I wanted to build a mini project and challenge myself to build something unconventional just for the purpose of building it and learning new things. I saw an idea for a project involving a QR code webpage and that took me onto a path of learning the details of how a QR code is generated.

The project is hosted at: https://nathancall.tech/qr-code-generator

If you would like to do this project yourself, this website helped me a lot: https://www.nayuki.io/page/creating-a-qr-code-step-by-step
