# qr-code-generator
This is a mini project involving custom code that generates a QR code using an HTML/JavaScript canvas.

I wanted to build a side project and challenge myself to build something unconventional just for the purpose of building it and learning new things. I saw an idea for a project involving a QR code webpage and that took me onto a path of learning the details of how a QR code is generated. 

The webpage will be located at https://qr.nathancall.tech/
